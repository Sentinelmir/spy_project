Spy Game (Browser Version)
This is a small personal project I made primarily for me and my friends. We love playing the board game "Spy", but while using existing apps, we noticed a few things that could be improved:

- switching the word with a button instead of tapping anywhere on the screen;

- the ability to add custom words and categories;

- a more convenient way to select the number of players and spies.

So I decided to create my own browser version of the game that can be opened on both mobile and desktop. Iâ€™ll be gradually adding more features over time.

Current Features:
- Player and spy count selection
- Multiple word categories (places, hobbies, food)
- Simple and user-friendly interface

Planned Features:
- Add custom words
- Personal account creation
- Possibly add a "room" feature so each player can view their word on their own phone
